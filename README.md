# Deep-Representations-and-Learning
This is a repo for Labs prepared for COMP0188 taught at University Collge London (UCL).

Dataset Download instructions
Dataset is uploaded to moodle please download them to access the files and for the lab exercise please upload it to the google colab on your user name. For lab exercises the dataset in the form of .csv can be copied to a directory csv, and the .jpg files can be copied to images directory in your respective google drive for convenience.

How to structure your project
Now that you’ve had a chance to configure your development environment, take a second now and download the code and datasets associated with the course
from the corresponding week uploaded on moodle.

Each week (that includes accompanying code and dataset) has its own directory. Each directory then includes: • The source code for each week.

Advantages of organised code and datasets
• Keeps the learning by week using project structure neat and tidy • Allows you to reuse datasets across multiple projects.
